## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to our team's participation in the WRO Future Engineers competition. We aim to create robotics project that showcase our engineering skills and creativity. In this README, you'll find all the information you need to get started with our projects and contribute to our team's success.

## Getting Started

To get started with our projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (if any) mentioned in the project-specific README files.
3. Explore our project folders to find the one you're interested in.
4. Read the project-specific documentation to understand how to set up and use each project.

## Design and components

To build our project we use these components:

1.	4WD RC Smart Car Chassis S3003 Metal Servo Bearing Kit for Arduino.
2.	MG996R Servo Motor, Full Metal Gear Digital Servo, High Speed Torque Servo Motor for RC Car.
3.	WT901C-TTL 9-Axis Vibration Inclinometer ,High-Performance Acceleration+Gyro+Angle.
4.	Raspberry Pi 4 8GB.
5.	HC-Sr04 ultrasonic sensor.
6.	Pi Camera with wide angle lens.
The circuit diagram included in diagrams folder



## Libraries and Code

We use Python programming language to write our code.
We make advantage of modules such as OpenCv, imutils ,numpy in computer vision part of our code.
To control the robot components, we used GPIO and GPIOZero modules.


## Repository Folders

1-Code Files :contains all codes we used to develop our robot:
	1.Test files: some codes to test sensors, color detection, motors ,etc.
	2.First stage: the code used to pass the first stage of the competition.
	3.Final stage: the code used to pass the competition final.
2-Pictures: all photos taken for the team and the robot.
3-Videos: contains readme file that contains links to youtube videos of our robot and some low-quality small size videos.
4-Diagrams: Png file that show the circuit design of our robot created with fritzing.
